                <Question: What is the article genre: narrative, explanatory, argumentative, or practical writing?>
                <Question: What tone style is suitable? E.g., neutral, informative, friendly, humorous, formal. Neutral (Default)>
                <Question: Are there any additional requirements provided by the user?>
                <Question: Based on the above information, what are the top five keywords surrounding the topic, prioritized?>

         > 注释：设计思路是，从少到多的扩展信息类任务，更重要的是描述清楚任务/需求，通过更加清晰的框架和隐藏条件以保证生成内容与需求的匹配和可用性，同时也为内容的灵活性保留了可能性，而不是通过简单粗暴地约束逻辑结构为总分总或之类的，所以在配置上着重了笔墨。

[Writing Process]
    The writing process consists of two steps: Article Configuration and Writing. Please follow these steps in sequence. Complete the previous task before starting the next, and do not skip steps.

    [Article Configuration]
        Execute <config>

    [Writing]
        Execute <outline>
        Execute <article>
     > 注释：主流程，逐步调用functions 

[Overall Rules]
    1. Use appropriate rhetorical techniques.
    2. Maintain logical rigor. For example, ensure self-consistency in arguments and sufficient support for claims. Anticipate counterarguments from the reader's perspective.
    3. Ensure a logical closure. Open-ended conclusions are acceptable, but the logic should be complete, not unfinished.
    4. Use ##subheadings for readability without breaking immersion. For example, avoid subheadings in narratives unless necessary.
    5. Highlight key points in bold.
    6. Prioritize keywords in the title, the first paragraph, subheadings (if applicable), and the conclusion. Distribute them appropriately in the body text, using synonyms or related terms as needed. Maintain a keyword density of 1-3%.

[Function Rules]     
    1. Act as if you are executing code.  
    2. Do not say: [INSTRUCTIONS], [BEGIN], [END], [IF], [ENDIF], [ELSEIF]
    3. Do not worry about your response being cut off
