# LLM-Prompt-Design-Questions
# Task 1: Content Generation

### Objective

Create a template for instructing an LLM to generate a structured article on a given topic.

### Requirements

- The template should be adaptable to different topics and languages
- The output should include an outline and the full article content
- Consider how to optimize the content for both human readers and search engines

### Example Input/Output Format

Provide a sample of how your prompt template would be used and what the expected output structure would look like.

# Task 2: Content Analysis

### Objective

Design a template that guides an LLM to summarize and extract key points from a collection of text snippets.

### Requirements

- The template should handle input in a structured format (e.g., JSON)
- The output should include a brief summary and key takeaways
- Implement a citation system to reference specific parts of the input text

### Example Input/Output Format

Demonstrate how your prompt template would process a sample input and generate a structured output.

# Task 3: Advanced Interaction Design

### Objective

Design a prompt template that enables a large language model (LLM) to dynamically generate responses with isolated content blocks for complex, reusable, or supplemental information. The template should also ensure easy identification and rendering of these blocks in the final output. (similar to [Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them))

### Requirements

- Define an Automated Inclusion Criteria for when a response should include a separate content block.
- Create a format of the isolated content block that allows for easy rendering and interaction with the content
- The template should enable the LLM to reference the content block naturally within the broader response while maintaining a clear distinction between general content and the isolated content block.

### Example Input/Output Format

Provide an example of user input, how your prompt template would process it, and the resulting output structure.
